// In JavaScript, the mean (also known as the average) of a set of numbers is calculated by summing up all the numbers and then dividing the sum by the count of the numbers. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the code you provided, along with the definition of the mean:

// Definition
// The mean (or average) is a measure of central tendency that gives the central value of a set of numbers. It is calculated by summing all the numbers in the set and then dividing the sum by the total count of the numbers.

// Code Explanation
// Here's your code again with comments explaining each part:

// javascript

const data = [22, 43, 2, 23, 44, 55]; // An array of numbers for which we want to find the mean

let sum = 0; // Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the numbers

// Loop through each number in the data array
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    sum += data[i]; // Add each number to the sum
}

// Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array
const mean = sum / data.length;

console.log(mean); // Output the mean to the console
