// String is a collection of characters that represent text. Strings are
//  conventionally implemented as arrays of characters, where each element represents a 
//  single character. They are essential for processing text data, forming the backbone of
//   algorithms that deal with text, such as natural language processing and information retrieval.



// There are some standard questions on the strings as mentioned below:

// Reverse String
// Valid Palindrome
// Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
// String to Integer (atoi)
// Longest Palindromic Substring
